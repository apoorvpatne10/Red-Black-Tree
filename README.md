# Red-Black-Tree
An extremely well tested and commented classic red black tree implementation. Worth a look if you are studying the material.
Supports
- addition
- deletion

Implemented in Python

_These implementations can be found in my data structures repository.
The reason I created a separate repository for the tree is to enable people to find this easily.
I personally searched a lot through GitHub while learning about RB trees and did not manage to find code that was well commented and well tested.
I've tried to heavily describe each rotation and with 2000 lines of tests, I think it's descriptive enough_
